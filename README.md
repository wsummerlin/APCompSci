AP Computer Science Sample Lab Code
=========

Java repository comprised of common lab problems in an AP Computer Science curriculum 

I'm an experienced programmer and developed all of these examples with a balance of efficiency and readability. Feel free to use any code you find helpful. All my methodology practices are pretty standard. 

Note - Some files import the apcslib.jar library. It can be found here: http://pavao.org/compsci/apcs/apcslib.jar (It will download when you click the link...it shouldn't take you to another page)

To use: create a java project, import apcslib.jar, then create a class within the project with the SAME name as the file (example: drawBenzine). Copy and paste the code - you're good to go.

Descriptions:
=========

  BuildClass - A cool program that draws a house and changes the color and size of the sun based on the current temperature. The sky color also changes based on some weather data. It interacts with the foracast.io api. It's dependant on the foracastio library. You can get that here: https://github.com/dvdme/forecastio-lib-java. You just need to add the forecastio-lib-java.jar to your project when it's created. 
  
  DrawBenzine - A basic program that will draw a hexagon and then a circle in the hexagon (it's supposed to look like benzine). It has a good ``while`` loop example and efficient manor of creating the hexagon.
  
  DayOf - An algorithm for calculating the day and month of Easter in the Gregorian calendar. Simply set the int y to the year you want to get the values for and run. For example if you set:
```int y = 2003;``` the value ```4/20``` would be printed to the console (along with the value of every object).

  ChangeCalc - Simple algorithm to calculate the number of coins in any given dollar amount. The program calculates the results based on change, so to enter values $1 or greater without a decimal point (multiply the desired value by 100). For example $0.90 would be entered as ```90``` and $2.94 would be entered as ```294```. 
  
  Rectangle - Class to calculate values related to a rectangle, inlcuding: Area - ```getArea()``` and Perimeter - ```getPerimeter()```. It can also draw a rectangle with the ```draw()``` function. The values can be set with the respective ```set``` functions - ```setX(double)```, ```setY(double)```, ```setWidth(double)``` and ```setHeight()```. There is a default constructor, but you should initialize the class by including ```Rectangle rectangle  = new Rectangle(double x, double y, width, height);``` in your main class code. All functions should be preceded with the object name used to initalize the class (ie ```rectangle.getHeight()```).
