APCompSci
=========

Java repository comprised of common lab problems in an AP Computer Science curriculum 

Note - All files import the apcslib.jar library. It can be found here: http://pavao.org/compsci/apcs/apcslib.jar 

To use: create a java project, import apcslib.jar, then create a class within the project with the SAME name as the file (example: drawBenzine). Copy and paste the code - you're good to go.
