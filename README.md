AP Computer Science Sample Lab Code
=========

Java repository comprised of common lab problems in an AP Computer Science curriculum 

I'm an experienced programmer and developed all of these examples with a balance of efficiency and readability. Feel free to use any code you find helpful. All my methodology practices are pretty standard. 

Note - All files import the apcslib.jar library. It can be found here: http://pavao.org/compsci/apcs/apcslib.jar (It will download when you click the link...it shouldn't take you to another page)

To use: create a java project, import apcslib.jar, then create a class within the project with the SAME name as the file (example: drawBenzine). Copy and paste the code - you're good to go.
